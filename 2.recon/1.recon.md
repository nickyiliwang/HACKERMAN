# Information Gathering and Enumeration

## OSINT Framework (Open-source intelligence)
OSINT framework focused on gathering information from free tools or resources. The intention is to help people find free OSINT resources. Some of the sites included might require registration or offer more data for $$$, but you should be able to get at least a portion of the available information for no cost.

https://osintframework.com

ie. https://instantusername.com/#/ will query most websites and check for username taken/registered
